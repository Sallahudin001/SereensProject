## **Before vs After**

### **Before** ‚ùå
```typescript
// Complex state management
const [appliedOffers, setAppliedOffers] = useState<any[]>([])
const [selectedUpsells, setSelectedUpsells] = useState<any[]>([])
const [bundleDiscounts, setBundleDiscounts] = useState<any[]>([])
const [showOffers, setShowOffers] = useState(true)

// Complex UI with multiple sections
<EnhancedUpsellSystem
  services={services}
  currentTotal={formData.subtotal}
  onOfferApplied={handleOfferApplied}
  onUpsellSelected={handleUpsellSelected}
  proposalId={undefined}
/>

// Complex pricing display
<span>Base Subtotal</span>
{selectedUpsells.length > 0 && (
  <div>Added Upgrades:</div>
)}
{appliedOffers.length > 0 && (
  <div>Special Offers:</div>
)}
```

### **After** ‚úÖ
```typescript
// Simple state management - only core pricing
const [formData, setFormData] = useState<PricingData>()

// Clean UI - just pricing breakdown
<div className="space-y-5 pt-2">
  <div>Subtotal</div>
  <div>Discounts</div>
  <div>Final Total</div>
</div>

// Simple data sync
useEffect(() => {
  updateData(formData)
}, [formData, updateData, data])
```
