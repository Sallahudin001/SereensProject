### **Better UX** ‚úÖ

## **Technical Implementation**

### **Data Flow**
1. Rep selects offers ‚Üí Stored in `proposal_offers` table
2. Customer views proposal ‚Üí Fetches proposal-specific offers
3. Customer toggles addons ‚Üí Real-time calculation updates
4. Final pricing ‚Üí Includes all selected options

### **Components Updated**
- `RepOfferSelector`: New amber styling matching customer view
- `InteractiveOffers`: Updated "Enhance Your Project" section
- `CustomerProposalView`: Fixed duplicates and calculations
- `EnhanceYourProject`: Better addon selection interface

### **State Management**
- `currentTotal` and `currentMonthlyPayment` properly managed
- Real-time updates via `calculateCurrentTotal()` and `calculateCurrentMonthlyPayment()`
- Robust null checks throughout

## **Critical Bug Fix ‚úÖ**

### **Issue**: ReferenceError: Cannot access 'currentTotal' before initialization
**Problem**: The `handleAddonToggle` function was calling `calculateCurrentTotal()` and `calculateCurrentMonthlyPayment()` before these functions were declared, causing a reference error.

**Root Cause**: Variable hoisting issues - the functions were being called in the handler before their useCallback declarations.

**Solution**: 
- Moved state declarations (`currentTotal`, `currentMonthlyPayment`) earlier in the component
- Removed premature function calls from `handleAddonToggle`
- Rely on existing useEffect to automatically recalculate when `selectedAddons` changes

**Files Fixed**: `components/customer/proposal-view.tsx`

## **Testing Recommendations**

1. **Rep Flow**: Create proposal with selected offers
2. **Customer View**: Verify single offers section appears correctly
3. **Addon Selection**: Test toggle switches and pricing updates
4. **Calculations**: Verify all pricing displays correctly
5. **Mobile**: Test responsive design on smaller screens
6. **Runtime**: Confirm no more "Cannot access before initialization" errors

The sales flow is now consistent, duplicate-free, properly calculated, and **runtime error-free** throughout the entire customer journey.
