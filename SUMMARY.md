# Email Uniqueness Implementation Summary

## Issue Identified

We identified that the application was allowing multiple user accounts to be created with the same email address. This occurred because:

1. The database schema did not have a unique constraint on the email column in the users table
2. The application relied entirely on Clerk for user authentication but didn't enforce email uniqueness in its own database
3. When syncing users from Clerk to the local database, there was no validation to prevent duplicate emails

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a comprehensive solution that:

1. **Adds a database-level constraint** to enforce email uniqueness
2. **Updates the user management code** to handle potential email conflicts
3. **Provides migration scripts** to safely apply the changes

## Key Changes

1. **Database Schema Changes**:
   - Added a UNIQUE constraint to the email column in the users table
   - Added an index for faster email lookups

2. **Code Updates**:
   - Modified user actions to check for existing emails before creating new users
   - Updated Clerk webhook handlers to properly handle email uniqueness
   - Implemented conflict resolution logic that updates existing records instead of creating duplicates

3. **Migration Tools**:
   - Created both automated and manual migration options
   - Implemented safety checks to handle existing duplicate emails

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Each email is now associated with only one user account
2. **Simplified User Management**: No more confusion with multiple accounts for the same email
3. **Better Security**: Reduces risks associated with account confusion or takeover attempts
4. **Improved User Experience**: Users won't encounter issues when trying to log in with an email that has multiple accounts

## How to Apply

We've provided two options for applying the changes:

1. **Automated Script**: `node scripts/apply-email-unique-constraint.js`
2. **Manual SQL Execution**: Run the SQL in `database/email_unique_constraint.sql` using your database client

The manual option is recommended due to potential database connection issues with the automated script.

## Next Steps

1. Apply the migration using one of the provided methods
2. Monitor the application logs for any issues related to email uniqueness
3. Consider implementing additional validation in the frontend to provide immediate feedback when a user tries to sign up with an existing email
