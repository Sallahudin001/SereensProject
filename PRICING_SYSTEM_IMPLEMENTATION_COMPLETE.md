## Overview

The pricing system has been completely reimplemented to properly separate product pricing management from financing plans. The system now provides a dedicated interface for managing actual product pricing data based on real services offered.

## Key Features Implemented

- base_price (Standard Price)
- min_price (Minimum Allowed Price)
