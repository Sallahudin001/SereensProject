# Duplicate Proposal Prevention Implementation

## Overview

This implementation addresses the issue of duplicate proposals being created during the discount request and email sending workflows. The solution implements a single source of truth for proposal creation with proper state management.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Draft Proposal Management** (`app/proposals/new/page.tsx`)

- Added `draftProposalId` state to track the current draft proposal
- Implemented `createOrUpdateDraftProposal()` function that:
  - Creates a proposal on first save
  - Updates the existing proposal on subsequent saves
  - Prevents duplicate creation by reusing the same proposal ID
- Auto-saves draft when navigating between steps (after customer info is filled)
- Shows draft status in the UI with proposal number

### 2. **Enhanced Proposal Creation Logic** (`app/actions/proposal-actions.ts`)

- Modified `createProposal()` to handle updates when an ID is provided
- Improved duplicate detection:
  - Looks for existing drafts within 24 hours (instead of 5 seconds)
  - Checks for draft statuses: `draft`, `draft_in_progress`, `draft_complete`, `draft_discount_review`
  - Updates existing drafts instead of creating new ones
- Added transaction support for updates with proper error handling

### 3. **Discount Request Flow** (`components/proposal/pricing-breakdown-form.tsx`)

- Modified `submitApprovalRequest()` to:
  - Use existing proposal ID if available
  - Only create a new proposal if no ID exists
  - Update existing proposal with latest pricing data before creating approval request
- Prevents creating duplicate proposals during discount approval workflow

### 4. **Email Sending Flow** (`components/proposal/signature-deposit-form.tsx`)

- Updated `handleSendProposal()` to:
  - Check for existing proposal ID first
  - Update the existing proposal with status `ready_to_send`
  - Only create a new proposal as a last resort with warning
- Ensures the same proposal is used throughout the workflow

### 5. **Proposal Service Layer** (`lib/proposal-service.ts`)

Created a centralized service for proposal management:
- `findExistingDraftProposal()`: Finds recent draft proposals for a customer
- `canUpdateProposal()`: Checks if a proposal can be updated
- `updateProposalStatus()`: Updates status with validation
- `isProposalLocked()`: Prevents concurrent edits
- `cleanupOldDrafts()`: Maintains database hygiene
- `requestDiscountApproval()`: Creates approval requests without new proposals

### 6. **API Endpoint** (`app/api/proposals/[id]/route.ts`)

- Created GET endpoint to fetch proposal details
- Includes pending approval request information
- Used by the pricing form to check approval status

### 7. **Database Enhancements** (`database/add-proposal-statuses.sql`)

- Added new proposal statuses for better state tracking
- Created indexes for performance optimization
- Added constraints to ensure data integrity

## Proposal Status Flow

```
draft → draft_in_progress → draft_complete → ready_to_send → sent → viewed → signed → completed
                  ↓
          draft_discount_review (when discount approval needed)
```

## Benefits

1. **No Duplicate Proposals**: Single proposal is created and updated throughout the workflow
2. **Better State Management**: Clear status tracking at each stage
3. **Improved Performance**: Optimized queries with proper indexes
4. **Data Integrity**: Constraints prevent invalid states
5. **User Experience**: Draft saving with visual feedback
6. **Concurrent Edit Protection**: Prevents race conditions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create New Proposal Flow**:
   - Start creating a proposal
   - Navigate through steps and verify draft is saved
   - Check that proposal ID remains the same

2. **Discount Approval Flow**:
   - Apply a discount exceeding user limit
   - Verify approval request uses existing proposal
   - Confirm no duplicate proposal is created

3. **Email Sending Flow**:
   - Complete proposal and send via email
   - Verify same proposal ID is used
   - Check status updates properly

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Browser refresh during creation
   - Multiple tabs with same proposal
   - Network interruptions

## Migration Steps

1. Apply the database migration:
   ```bash
   psql -U your_user -d your_database -f database/add-proposal-statuses.sql
   ```

2. Deploy the updated code

3. Monitor for any issues with existing proposals

## Future Enhancements

1. **Session Recovery**: Store draft state in localStorage for browser crashes
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent edits by multiple users
3. **Audit Trail**: Enhanced logging of all proposal changes
4. **Auto-cleanup**: Scheduled job to clean abandoned drafts
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for live collaboration
